# What Does "Fetching Dynamic Content from an External Source" Mean?

Instead of putting all the content (Home, About, Contact, etc.) directly in the HTML file, you store each section's content in separate HTML files (or use APIs to get content from a server). Then, JavaScript dynamically loads these files when the user clicks a link, updating the content of the page.

This approach allows for a cleaner, modular design. It is also commonly used in modern web development for better performance and maintainability.

Example Structure:
Let’s assume you have the following directory structure:
/my-website
    ├── index.html            (Main website file)
    ├── about.html            (Content for the About section)
    ├── contact.html          (Content for the Contact section)
    ├── script.js             (JavaScript file to dynamically load content)
    ├── styles.css            (Stylesheet for your website)

Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Separate HTML Files for Content
You can place the content for different sections (like About, Contact, etc.) in separate HTML files. For example:

about.html will contain only the "About Us" content.
contact.html will contain only the "Contact" content.

about.html
<!-- 
<section id="aboutSection">
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a web development company specializing in creating dynamic web applications.</p>
</section>
-->

contact.html
<!--
<section id="contactSection">
    <h1>Contact Us</h1>
    <p>Email us at support@example.com or call 123-456-7890!</p>
</section>
-->

These HTML files contain just the specific content that will be loaded dynamically into your main page (index.html).
