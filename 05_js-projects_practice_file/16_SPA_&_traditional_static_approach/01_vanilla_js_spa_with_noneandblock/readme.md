# Yes, you're right. Since you are using display: none; and display: block;, the sections are hidden by default, and you will need JavaScript to toggle the visibility of those sections when users click on the navigation links. Without JavaScript, the sections will remain hidden except for any section that has the active class applied

The issue might be that the JavaScript isn't correctly toggling the visibility of the about and contact pages.

Let’s make sure the JavaScript is properly set up to:

Hide all sections initially.
Show the correct section when the corresponding navigation link is clicked.
Here’s how to pair your CSS (using display: none/block) with a simple JavaScript setup.

Example JavaScript to Show/Hide Sections
Ensure each section starts as display: none in CSS.
Use JavaScript to show the section corresponding to the clicked link and hide the others.
HTML (index.html)
CSS (styles.css)
JavaScript (script.js)

How It Works:
Hide All Sections: The hideAllSections() function removes the active class from all sections, making them hidden (display: none).
Show Selected Section: When a link is clicked, the corresponding section becomes visible by adding the active class (display: block).
Prevent Default Behavior: We use e.preventDefault() to prevent the default link behavior, so the page doesn’t jump to # or reload.
Default View: By calling showSection(homeSection) at the end, the Home section is displayed by default when the page first loads.
Why Sections Aren't Showing:
The sections are initially hidden using display: none; in the CSS. Without JavaScript to toggle visibility by adding/removing the active class, the sections remain hidden.
If the JavaScript isn’t properly toggling the active class, the about and contact sections won’t be displayed.
Troubleshooting:
Check the Script File: Ensure the script.js file is properly linked in your HTML file. If it’s not loading, the toggling won’t work.
Look for Errors: Open the browser's developer tools (F12), check the "Console" tab, and see if there are any JavaScript errors.
Correct IDs: Ensure the id attributes in the HTML match those being referenced in JavaScript.
