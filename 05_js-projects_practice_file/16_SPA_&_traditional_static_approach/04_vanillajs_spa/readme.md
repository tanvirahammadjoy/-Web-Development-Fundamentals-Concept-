# To create a single-page website using only vanilla JavaScript, you can follow these steps

Basic HTML Structure: First, create the structure of the webpage using HTML.

CSS for Styling: Add basic styling to make the page visually appealing.

JavaScript for Interactivity: Use JavaScript to handle navigation or dynamic content updates without needing a page reload.

Example: Single-Page Website (Vanilla JS)
HTML (index.html)
CSS (styles.css)
JavaScript (script.js)

How it Works:
The HTML provides a basic structure with navigation links.
CSS adds styling and hides all sections by default, displaying only the active one.
<!-- JavaScript handles the dynamic content loading by listening for click events on the navigation links and injecting the corresponding content into the <main> tag. -->
This approach uses vanilla JavaScript for the dynamic loading of different sections on a single page without reloading the browser.
