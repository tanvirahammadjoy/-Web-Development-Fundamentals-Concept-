# Let's explore the frequency counter approach for the anagram checker. This method improves efficiency by avoiding the sorting step, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Instead, we will count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the counts, which has a linear time complexity of O(n)

Frequency Counter Approach
Steps to Implement:
Preprocess the strings to remove spaces and convert them to lowercase.
Count Character Frequencies:
Use an object (hash map) to store the count of each character for both strings.
Compare the Frequency Counters:
Ensure that both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies.

Explanation of Frequency Counter Approach:
Preprocessing:

Same as before, we remove spaces and convert both strings to lowercase.
Frequency Counting:

We loop through each character of the first string (cleanedStr1) and build a frequency counter (frequencyCounter1), where each character becomes a key, and the value is the count of occurrences of that character.
We do the same for the second string (cleanedStr2) to build frequencyCounter2.
Comparison:

After building both frequency counters, we check if the character frequencies match.
If any character has a different frequency in the two strings, they are not anagrams.
Efficiency:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings. Since we're just iterating over the strings and building frequency counters, this is more efficient than sorting.
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the space used by the frequency counters.
Edge Cases to Consider:
Different Length Strings: If the strings are of different lengths, they cannot be anagrams, and we immediately return false.

Special Characters: If you need to ignore special characters or numbers, modify the preprocessing step to remove non-alphabetic characters:
cleanedStr1 = str1.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '').toLowerCase();
cleanedStr2 = str2.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '').toLowerCase();

Testing with Examples:
Basic Example:
console.log(areAnagrams("Listen", "Silent")); // true

Strings with Different Characters:
console.log(areAnagrams("Hello", "World")); // false

Edge Case (Case Sensitivity):
console.log(areAnagrams("Hello", "Olelh")); // true

Ignoring Punctuation:
console.log(areAnagrams("Astronomer!", "Moon starer!")); // true (after removing punctuation)

Optional Enhancements:
User Interface: You could add an input form on a webpage where users can enter two strings to check if they are anagrams.
Optimized Feedback: Add more specific output, like showing which characters don't match if they aren't anagrams.
Would you like help with creating a simple UI for this or adding any additional features to the project?
