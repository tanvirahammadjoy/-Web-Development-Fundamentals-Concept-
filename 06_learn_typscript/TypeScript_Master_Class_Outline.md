# Here's a master class outline on TypeScript, designed to help you master key concepts and progressively advance your skills

Master Class on TypeScript

1. Introduction to TypeScript
What is TypeScript?
Superset of JavaScript, static typing, compiled language.
Why Use TypeScript?
Benefits like type safety, error catching at compile time, better tooling support.
Setting Up a TypeScript Project
Installation using npm or yarn.
Configuring tsconfig.json.
2. Type Annotations
Primitive Types
string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.
Type Inference
Letting TypeScript infer types when possible.
Union and Intersection Types
Combining types using | (union) and & (intersection).
Type Aliases
Creating custom types for readability.
3. Advanced Types
Tuples
Fixed-size arrays with known types at each position.
Enums
Defining a set of named constants.
Literal Types
Using exact values as types (e.g., const values).
Type Assertions
Explicitly specifying a type (as keyword or angle bracket syntax).
4. Functions in TypeScript
Typed Function Signatures
Function parameter and return types.
Optional and Default Parameters
Specifying optional parameters with ? and setting default values.
Function Overloads
Declaring multiple function signatures.
5. Classes and Interfaces
Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript
TypeScript classes, properties, and methods.
Inheritance & Polymorphism
Extending classes and overriding methods.
Abstract Classes
Defining blueprints for other classes.
Interfaces
Defining contracts for objects, functions, and classes.
Implementing Interfaces
Using implements for class-based interfaces.
Intersection and Extension of Interfaces
6. Generics
What are Generics?
Allowing functions and classes to be flexible over different types.
Generic Functions
Writing type-safe functions that work with multiple types.
Generic Classes and Interfaces
Applying generics to class structures and interfaces.
7. Modules and Namespaces
Understanding Modules
ES6 modules in TypeScript (import, export).
Namespaces
Organizing code using namespaces.
Declaration Merging
Combining declarations of the same name across different files.
8. TypeScript Utility Types
Partial, Required, Readonly, Record
Built-in utility types to manipulate object types.
Pick, Omit, Exclude, Extract
Working with type subsets and exclusions.
9. TypeScript with React (or other frameworks)
Using TypeScript in React
Typing props, state, and hooks in React components.
Typing Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
Context API and TypeScript
10. TypeScript and Node.js
Using TypeScript with Node.js
Working with Express.js in TypeScript
Typing Express.js routes, middleware, and request/response objects.
11. TypeScript Decorators
What are Decorators?
Experimental feature for meta-programming (e.g., class decorators, method decorators).
Decorator Factories
Creating customizable decorators.
12. Advanced TypeScript Features
Type Guards
Narrowing types with typeof, instanceof, and custom type guard functions.
Mapped Types
Transforming existing types with keyof and mapped syntax.
Conditional Types
Creating types based on conditions (extends and ternary logic).
Discriminated Unions
Simplifying complex type checks with tagged union types.
13. Working with Third-Party Libraries
TypeScript and JavaScript Libraries
Using TypeScript with non-typed libraries.
Installing and Using Type Definitions
Using @types packages from DefinitelyTyped.
Writing Custom Type Definitions
Creating .d.ts files for libraries without types.
14. TypeScript Best Practices
Strict Mode
Enabling strict mode for stricter type checking.
Linting and Formatting
Using ESLint and Prettier with TypeScript.
Code Refactoring Tips
Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript.
Handling Large Codebases
Organizing and scaling TypeScript projects efficiently.
15. Testing TypeScript
Unit Testing with TypeScript
Using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha with TypeScript.
Type-Safe Mocking
Typing mock functions and modules.
Learning Path & Resources
Official Documentation
Deep dive into TypeScript docs.
TypeScript Playground
Experiment with TypeScript online.
Project-Based Learning
Build projects like a Todo app, API server, or TypeScript utilities library.
This course will progressively advance your understanding from the basics to advanced, including working with libraries and frameworks. Would you like resources on any of these topics to get started?
