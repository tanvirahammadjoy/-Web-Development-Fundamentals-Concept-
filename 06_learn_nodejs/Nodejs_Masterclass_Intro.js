// Masterclass on Node.js
// 1. What is Node.js?
// Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables server-side scripting, transforming JavaScript from a client-side language into one capable of handling server-based tasks.

// Core Features of Node.js:

// Asynchronous: Node.js operates on an event-driven architecture, allowing it to handle multiple tasks without waiting for one task to complete before starting another.
// Non-blocking I/O: It excels in handling I/O operations efficiently, even under heavy load, without blocking other processes.
// Single-threaded: Despite its event-driven nature, Node.js runs in a single-threaded environment, making it lightweight while being capable of handling concurrent operations via event callbacks.
// Key Applications:

// REST APIs, real-time chat applications, data streaming applications, and more.
// 2. The Node.js Runtime Environment
// The Node.js runtime is built around the V8 engine, the same engine used by Chrome to execute JavaScript. However, Node.js adds additional libraries to handle non-browser-related tasks (like file system manipulation, networking, and operating system interaction).

// Components of Node.js Runtime:
// JavaScript Execution (V8 Engine): The engine compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, making the execution super fast.
// Event Loop: This manages all asynchronous operations in Node.js, allowing it to perform non-blocking operations.
// libuv: A C library that provides Node.js with its asynchronous I/O operations, threading, and event handling. It underpins the event loop and asynchronous nature of Node.js.
// Node.js Modules: Built-in modules (like HTTP, File System, Crypto, etc.) extend JavaScript capabilities beyond what is available in the browser.
// 3. Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O Model
// Node.js follows an event-driven architecture where the system emits events when actions occur, and registered event handlers listen for these events. This approach ensures that no task (e.g., a database query, file read/write) blocks the main thread, allowing Node.js to handle thousands of requests simultaneously.

// Event Loop:

// The event loop is the heart of Node.js. It listens for events and callbacks and processes them asynchronously, enabling the execution of multiple operations without stalling the program.

// Example:
const fs = require('fs');

// Asynchronous file read
fs.readFile('example.txt', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data.toString());
});
console.log('This will execute before the file read completes!');

// Non-Blocking I/O:

// Node.js does not wait for file I/O operations, database queries, or HTTP requests to complete before moving on. It queues them and proceeds with other operations, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing resource wastage.

// 4. Why Node.js? Use Cases, Strengths, and Limitations
// Why Use Node.js?

// Strengths:

// Scalability: Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications. The event-driven, non-blocking architecture is perfect for systems that handle numerous connections concurrently.
// Fast: Node.js uses the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript to native machine code, ensuring high performance.

// Real-time applications: Perfect for building chat applications, gaming servers, and collaboration tools (like Google Docs) due to its event-driven nature.
// JSON-friendly: Since JavaScript is used both on the client and server side, it simplifies communication between them, particularly when dealing with JSON.
// Use Cases:

// REST APIs: Handling HTTP requests/responses, authenticating users, interacting with databases, etc.
// Real-time web applications: Instant messaging apps, online gaming platforms.
// Data streaming: Node.js can handle large-scale, low-latency streams of data, such as video streaming or real-time data feeds.
// Microservices: Its lightweight nature is ideal for building microservice architectures, enabling independent services to communicate effectively.
// Limitations:

// CPU-intensive tasks: Node.js is not ideal for heavy computational tasks, such as image processing or number-crunching algorithms. Since it runs on a single thread, these tasks can block the event loop, causing performance degradation.
// Callback Hell: Although there are modern alternatives like Promises and async/await, excessive use of callbacks can lead to deeply nested code structures, making it difficult to maintain.

// 5. Installing Node.js and Setting Up a Development Environment
// Setting up Node.js is straightforward:

// Installation:
// Windows/Mac/Linux:

// Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org.
// Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (LTS is recommended).
// Run the installer and follow the prompts.
// Linux (via package manager): For Ubuntu:

// sudo apt update
// sudo apt install nodejs
// sudo apt install npm

// Verify Installation: After installation, you can verify by running:
// node -v
// npm -v

// IDE:
// Use any text editor, though Visual Studio Code is highly recommended for its JavaScript and Node.js support.
// NPM (Node Package Manager):

// With Node.js, npm gets installed automatically. Itâ€™s used to install, update, and manage packages/modules in your Node.js project.
// Example:

// npm install express

// 6. Running Your First Node.js Program (hello-world.js)
// Let's walk through running a simple Node.js program.

// Step 1: Create a new file:
// In your development environment, create a file named hello-world.js.

// Step 2: Write a simple program:

// console.log('Hello, World from Node.js!');

// Step 3: Run the program: Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where hello-world.js is located, and run:

// node hello-world.js

// You should see the output:

// Hello, World from Node.js!

// Explanation:
// console.log() is a basic function in JavaScript used to output information to the console. When you run node hello-world.js, Node.js interprets and executes the file, printing the message to the console.

// Final Thoughts
// This masterclass covers the fundamental concepts of Node.js, including its runtime environment, event-driven architecture, and use cases. Once you have Node.js installed and running, the real power comes from leveraging its non-blocking, event-driven model to build scalable and efficient applications.

// In the next part, we can dive deeper into building more complex applications, including working with modules, packages, and popular frameworks like Express.
