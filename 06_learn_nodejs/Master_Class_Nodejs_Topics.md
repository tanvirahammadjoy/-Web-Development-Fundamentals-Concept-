Testing APIs (Postman, automated testing with Mocha/Chai)
8. Event-Driven Architecture
EventEmitter class in Node.js
Creating and handling custom events
Real-world use cases for event-driven programming
9. Security in Node.js
Common security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
Preventing security risks in Node.js apps
Best practices for handling authentication (JWT, OAuth)
Securing HTTP headers using middleware like helmet
Rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse
10. Building Real-time Applications
Introduction to WebSockets
Building a real-time chat application using socket.io
Managing real-time data with EventEmitters
Pushing updates from server to client
11. Testing in Node.js
Unit testing using Mocha/Chai or Jest
Writing testable code in Node.js
Integration testing (Supertest for APIs)
Mocking and stubbing in tests
Test-driven development (TDD) and best practices
12. Error Handling and Debugging
Error types in Node.js (system errors vs operational errors)
Global error handling in Node.js
Debugging Node.js applications using tools like node-inspect
Logging errors (winston, morgan)
Graceful error handling for better user experience
13. Working with File Systems and Streams
Using the fs module for file operations (synchronous and asynchronous)
Streams in Node.js: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams
Working with large data using streams (handling buffers, piping, etc.)
Use cases of streams in real-world applications
14. Microservices Architecture
Introduction to microservices and its advantages in Node.js
Breaking monolithic applications into smaller services
Communication between microservices (REST, gRPC, message queues)
Service discovery and orchestration
15. Performance Optimization
Profiling Node.js apps (memory leaks, performance bottlenecks)
Cluster module for scaling Node.js apps
Caching strategies (in-memory caching with Redis)
Optimizing database queries for better performance
Managing CPU-bound tasks with worker_threads
16. Deployment and DevOps
Environment Variables:
Managing sensitive data with .env files
