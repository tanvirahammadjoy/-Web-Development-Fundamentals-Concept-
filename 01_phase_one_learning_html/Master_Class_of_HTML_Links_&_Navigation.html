    <!-- Master Class on HTML Links & Navigation -->
    <!-- HTML links (also known as hyperlinks) and navigation are fundamental to how the web operates.
     They allow users to navigate between pages, sections of a page, and external resources.
     This class will cover the structure of links, various attributes, navigation best practices,
     and accessibility considerations. -->

    <!-- 1. Basic Structure of an HTML Link (<a> Element) -->
    <!-- The anchor (<a>) element is used to create links.
        The most important attribute of the anchor tag is href (hyperlink reference),
        which defines the target URL of the link. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
    <!-- The text between the opening and closing <a> tags (Visit Example Website) is what users see and click on. -->
    <!-- The href attribute points to the destination URL. -->

    <!-- 2. Internal Links (Same Website Navigation) -->
    <!-- Internal links are used to navigate between different pages of the same website or to different sections within a page. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a href="/about.html">About Us</a>
    <!-- Here, /about.html refers to another page on the same website. -->

    <!-- In-Page Links: -->
    <!-- You can link to specific sections of the same page using in-page anchors (also called fragment identifiers). -->

    <!-- First, you need an element with an id attribute to link to: -->
    <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>

    <!-- Then, create a link to that section: -->
    <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>

    <!-- Notes: -->
    <!-- #section1 links to the element with the id="section1". -->

    <!-- 3. External Links (Navigating to Another Website) -->
    <!-- External links point to web pages on other domains or websites. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
      >Search on Google</a
    >
    <!-- The target="_blank" attribute opens the link in a new tab. -->

    <!-- 4. Email Links -->
    <!-- To link to an email address, use the mailto: scheme in the href attribute. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send Email</a>
    <!-- Clicking this will open the user’s default email client. -->

    <!-- Adding Subject & Body: -->
    <a
      href="mailto:someone@example.com?subject=Hello&body=I wanted to reach out..."
      >Email Us</a
    >
    <!-- This pre-populates the email subject and body. -->

    <!-- 5. Telephone Links -->
    <!-- You can make links that dial phone numbers when clicked, useful for mobile websites. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>

    <!-- 6. Link Attributes -->
    <!-- href: Specifies the URL the link points to. -->
    <!-- target: Specifies where to open the linked document. Common values include: -->
    <!-- _self: Default, opens in the same tab. -->
    <!-- _blank: Opens in a new tab or window. -->
    <!-- _parent: Opens in the parent frame (used for iframe-based layouts). -->
    <!-- _top: Opens in the full body of the window, exiting frames or iframes. -->

    <!-- rel: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document, often used for SEO or security purposes. -->

    <!-- Common values: -->
    <!-- noopener (recommended with target="_blank"): Prevents the new page from accessing the linking page's window object. -->
    <!-- nofollow: Tells search engines not to pass link equity (useful for external, paid, or user-generated links). -->

    <!-- 7. Buttons vs Links -->
    <!-- Although links (<a>) are designed for navigation, buttons (<button>) are often used for actions within web pages (e.g., submitting forms). However, you may see buttons used for navigation or styled as clickable links. -->

    <!-- Example of a Button Acting as a Link: -->
    <button onclick="window.location.href='https://www.example.com';">
      Go to Example
    </button>

    <!-- 8. HTML5 Navigation Elements -->
    <!-- For structuring navigation links, HTML5 introduced the <nav> element. It’s a semantic element used to group together navigational links, improving SEO and accessibility. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <!-- <nav> wraps a group of navigation links. -->
    <!-- <ul> (unordered list) groups items in a list format for improved structure and accessibility. -->

    <!-- 9. Accessibility Considerations for Links -->
    <!-- Descriptive Text: Avoid using generic link texts like "click here" or "read more."
     Instead, use descriptive text that explains what the link does. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <a href="/pricing">See our pricing plans</a>

    <!-- ARIA Roles: When using custom interactive elements that act as links (like buttons styled as links),
     ensure that screen readers recognize them as navigational links. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <button role="link" onclick="window.location.href='/products';">
      View Products
    </button>

    <!-- Keyboard Navigation: Make sure all links are accessible by keyboard.
     Users should be able to tab through links and activate them using Enter. -->

    <!-- 10. Best Practices for Links & Navigation -->
    <!-- 1 Use Absolute URLs for External Links: For internal links, use relative URLs to allow for easier portability of your website across domains and environments. -->
    <!-- 2 Open External Links in a New Tab: For external sites, using target="_blank" is helpful, but remember to include rel="noopener" for security. -->
    <!-- 3 Anchor Links for Navigation: Use anchor links when users need to jump to specific sections of the page, improving UX on longer pages. -->
    <!-- 4 Avoid Dead Links: Ensure all links work and don't lead to 404 pages. This improves both SEO and user experience. -->
    <!-- 5 Optimize for Mobile: Use clickable touch-friendly elements, especially for phone numbers and emails, so users can interact with them easily on mobile devices. -->

    <!-- 11. Advanced Navigation (SPA & Hash-based Routing) -->
    <!-- For Single Page Applications (SPAs), you can use JavaScript to handle navigation without reloading the page. -->

    <!-- Example: -->
    <script src="">
      document.querySelector("a").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        window.history.pushState({}, "", this.href);
      });
    </script>

    <!-- This approach manipulates the browser’s history API for smoother navigation in SPAs, making it feel like a multi-page application. -->

    Conclusion
    <!-- Understanding and mastering links and navigation is essential to web development.
     Whether building simple static sites or complex web apps, properly structured links enhance both usability and accessibility,
     while organized navigation elements ensure users can move seamlessly across your site. With attention to detail,
     your websites will offer a great user experience across all devices and platforms. -->
