    <!-- A master class on HTML forms involves understanding the structure, attributes,
     and best practices for creating accessible, responsive, and secure forms. 
     Here's a breakdown of the essential concepts, features, and advanced techniques in creating HTML forms. -->

    <!-- 1. Basic Structure of HTML Forms -->
    <!-- An HTML form is used to collect user input and submit it to a server for processing. Here's a basic structure: -->
    <form action="/submit" method="POST">
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />

      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      
      <!-- <form>: The form tag defines the form itself. Important attributes: -->
      <!-- action: The URL where the form data will be sent. -->
      <!-- method: The HTTP method (GET or POST) used to submit the form. POST is preferred for sensitive data. -->

      <!-- 2. Form Elements
    Forms consist of various elements to accept different types of user input.

    Common Form Elements:
    <input>: The most versatile element, used for various types of input fields.

    type="text": Single-line text input.
    type="email": Email input with built-in validation.
    type="password": Obscured text for passwords.
    type="number": Input restricted to numbers.
    type="radio" and type="checkbox": Selectable options.
    type="submit": Button to submit the form.
    <textarea>: For multi-line text input. -->
      <textarea name="comments" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>

      <!-- <select>: A dropdown menu for selecting options. -->
      <select name="options">
        <option value="1">Option 1</option>
        <option value="2">Option 2</option>
      </select>
      <!-- 
      3. Form Validation
    HTML5 introduced built-in form validation, which can save time and ensure data integrity.

    Built-in Validation Attributes:
    required: Ensures the field is not empty.
    pattern: Specifies a regular expression the input must match.
    min and max: Set limits on numerical values.
    maxlength: Restricts the number of characters in a text input.
    Example of using validation: -->
      <input
        type="text"
        name="username"
        required
        pattern="[A-Za-z0-9]{5,15}"
        title="5 to 15 alphanumeric characters"
      />

      <!-- 4. Accessibility in Forms
    Making forms accessible ensures that people using screen readers or other assistive technologies can interact with your forms.

    <label>: Every input field should be associated with a label using the for attribute or by wrapping the input inside the label. -->
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />

      <!-- Fieldsets and Legends: Use these to group related form elements and provide a descriptive context. -->
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Personal Information</legend>
        <input type="text" name="first_name" />
        <input type="text" name="last_name" />
      </fieldset>

      <!-- Tab Indexing: Control the navigation flow with tabindex to ensure an intuitive experience for keyboard users. -->
      <!-- 
      5. Advanced Input Types
    HTML5 introduced new input types that enhance user experience by offering context-specific keyboard layouts, built-in validation, and more.

    ate, time, datetime-local: Date and time pickers.
    color: A color picker input.
    range: A slider to select a numerical value within a range.
    Example: -->
      <label for="birthday">Birthday:</label>
      <input type="date" id="birthday" name="birthday" />

      <!-- 6. Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Forms To ensure forms are user-friendly
      across different devices, follow these practices: -->

      <!-- Use media queries to adjust form layout on smaller screens. -->
      <!-- @media (max-width: 600px) { form { display: block; } } -->

      <!-- Use responsive input sizes: -->
      <!-- input[type="text"], select { width: 100%; padding: 8px; } -->

      <!-- Optimize touch input: Increase clickable area for mobile devices by using larger buttons and spacing inputs. -->
    </form>

    <!-- 7. Security Best Practices for Forms Security is critical when dealing with
    user input to prevent attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site
    Request Forgery (CSRF). Use HTTPS: Always submit forms over HTTPS to ensure
    data encryption. Input sanitization: Always sanitize user input on the
    server side to prevent malicious data. CSRF tokens: Implement CSRF tokens in
    your forms to protect against cross-site attacks. Example of a CSRF token in
    a form (in Django-like syntax): -->
    <form action="/submit" method="POST">
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"
        value="your_csrf_token_here"
      />
      <!-- 8. Form Submission & Server Interaction Different Submission Methods: -->
      <!-- Traditional Page Reload: When the form is submitted using a submit button, -->
      <!-- the page reloads, and data is sent to the server: -->
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <!-- AJAX Submissions: Use JavaScript to submit the form without reloading the page. Example using fetch: -->
    <form id="myForm">
      <input type="text" name="name" required />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <!-- 9. Customizing Form Styles By default, browsers apply their styles to form
    elements. You can customize them to fit your design. Example: -->

    <!-- input, select, button {
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    }

    input:focus, select:focus {
    outline: none;
    border-color: #007BFF;
    }

    button {
    background-color: #28a745;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    } -->

    <!-- 10. File Uploads HTML forms can handle file uploads using the file input
    type. Remember to set the enctype attribute to handle file uploads
    correctly. -->

    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      document
        .getElementById("myForm")
        .addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
          e.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
          const formData = new FormData(this);

          fetch("/submit", {
            method: "POST",
            body: formData,
          })
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => console.log(data));
        });
    </script>

    <!-- Summary Checklist for Forms: Use semantic HTML elements. Always associate
    labels with form controls. Ensure accessibility with aria attributes and
    labels. Apply client-side validation, but always validate on the server.
    Secure your forms with HTTPS and CSRF protection. Make forms responsive and
    touch-friendly for mobile devices. Mastering these core concepts of HTML
    forms will help you create effective and user-friendly forms for a variety
    of web applications. -->
