// 2. JavaScript's Single-Threaded Nature
// Understanding Single-Threaded Execution
// JavaScript operates on a single thread, meaning it can execute one operation at a time. This design simplifies concurrency but introduces challenges in handling asynchronous operations.

// The Call Stack Explained
// Definition: A stack data structure that keeps track of function calls.
// Execution Flow: Functions are pushed onto the stack when invoked and popped off once executed.
// Example:
function first() {
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Second function");
}

first();

// Call Stack Process:
// first() is pushed onto the stack.
// first() calls second(), which is then pushed onto the stack.
// second() executes and logs "Second function".
// second() is popped off the stack.
// first() completes and is popped off the stack.
// Limitations of Single-Threading
// Blocking Operations: Long-running synchronous tasks can block the call stack, making the application unresponsive.
// Concurrency Challenges: Handling multiple asynchronous operations requires careful management to avoid callback hell and ensure efficient execution.

// 3. The Event Loop: An Overview
// What is the Event Loop?
// The Event Loop is a fundamental concept that enables JavaScript to perform non-blocking, asynchronous operations despite its single-threaded nature. It continuously checks the call stack and task queues to determine what to execute next.

// History and Evolution
// Early Implementations: Initial JavaScript environments relied heavily on callbacks for asynchronous operations.
// Advancements: Introduction of Promises and async/await syntax improved readability and manageability.
// Modern Enhancements: Integration with Web APIs and the development of sophisticated scheduling algorithms.
// Why the Event Loop Matters
// Understanding the Event Loop is crucial for:

// Optimizing Performance: Writing efficient code that leverages asynchronous capabilities.
// Debugging: Identifying and resolving issues related to asynchronous execution and event handling.
// Advanced Development: Building complex applications that require precise control over asynchronous operations.

// 4. Call Stack Deep Dive
// How the Call Stack Works
// Function Invocation: Each function call adds a new frame to the call stack.
// Execution Context: Each frame contains information about the function's execution context, including variables and scope.
// Stack Frames Lifecycle: Push when invoked, pop when execution completes.

// Stack Frames and Execution Contexts
// Global Execution Context: The default context where global code runs.
// Function Execution Contexts: Created for each function invocation.
// Example:
function a() {
  function b() {
    console.log("Inside b");
  }
  b();
}

a();

// Call Stack Process:
// Global context is pushed.
// a() is invoked and pushed.
// b() is invoked within a() and pushed.
// b() executes and is popped.
// a() completes and is popped.
// Global context remains until script execution ends.
// Handling Synchronous Code
// Sequential Execution: Functions are executed one after another.
// Blocking Behavior: Synchronous operations can block the call stack, preventing other code from executing until completion.

// 5. Task Queues and Execution Contexts
// Macro Tasks vs. Micro Tasks
// Macro Tasks: Include events like setTimeout, setInterval, and I/O operations.
// Micro Tasks: Include Promises, process.nextTick (Node.js), and MutationObservers.
// Execution Priority: Microtasks are executed before the next macro task.

// The Task Queue (Macrotasks)
// Definition: Queue where macro tasks are stored.
// Examples: setTimeout, setInterval, UI rendering events.
// Processing: After the call stack is empty, the Event Loop processes the next macro task from the queue.

// The Microtask Queue
// Definition: Queue for micro tasks with higher priority than macro tasks.
// Examples: Promise callbacks (.then, .catch, .finally), MutationObserver.
// Processing: After each macro task, all micro tasks are processed before moving to the next macro task.
// Prioritization and Order of Execution
// Execute all code in the current call stack.
// Process all microtasks in the microtask queue.
// Render any pending UI updates.
// Process the next macro task from the macro task queue.
// Repeat the cycle.

// 6. Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript
// Callbacks
// Definition: Functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later.
// Example:
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback executed");
}, 1000);

// Challenges: Can lead to callback hell, making code hard to read and maintain.
// Promises
// Definition: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
// States: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected.
// Example:
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise fulfilled");
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then((message) => console.log(message));

// Benefits: Improved readability and better error handling compared to callbacks.
// Async/Await Syntax
// Definition: Syntactic sugar over Promises, allowing asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style.
// Example:
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchData();

// Advantages: Cleaner code structure and easier to understand asynchronous flows.
// Event Emitters and Observables
// Event Emitters: Objects that emit named events, allowing listeners to respond to those events.
// Example: Node.js EventEmitter
// Observables: Represent streams of data that can be observed over time.
// Example: RxJS Observables
// Use Cases: Suitable for handling multiple asynchronous events and complex data streams.
// 7. Microtasks and Macrotasks in Detail
// Understanding Microtasks
// Execution Timing: After the current call stack is empty but before rendering and macro tasks.
// Use Cases: Promise callbacks

// Understanding Microtasks (Continued)
// Execution Timing: Microtasks execute immediately after the current call stack clears, ensuring their priority before rendering and macro tasks. This means that microtasks can delay rendering or block the processing of macro tasks if many are queued.

// Use Cases: Primarily used for promise resolutions, mutation observers, and other critical callbacks that should happen sooner than macro tasks.

// Example:
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macro task - Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask - Promise resolved");
});

console.log("End");

// Execution Order:

// Synchronous Code (Start and End) runs first.
// Microtasks (Promise resolved) run before the next macro task.
// Macro Tasks (Timeout) are executed after the microtask queue is empty.
// Output:

// sql
// Copy code
// Start
// End
// Microtask - Promise resolved
// Macro task - Timeout

// Understanding Macrotasks
// Execution Timing: These tasks are placed in the task queue, executed one after another once the current call stack and all microtasks are cleared. They include timeouts, event listeners, network callbacks, and other operations.

// Use Cases: Ideal for tasks that donâ€™t need to be executed immediately after the current code finishes but should happen relatively soon. This includes DOM events (click, input), setTimeout, and I/O operations.

// Example:
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macro task - Timeout");
}, 0);

document.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Macro task - Event listener");
});

console.log("End");

// Execution Order:

// Synchronous code (Start, End) is executed.
// The macro tasks (timeout, event listener) execute in the order they were added once the stack is empty.

// 8. Rendering and the Event Loop
// Browser Rendering Process
// The browser rendering engine works alongside the event loop. Although JavaScript code execution is prioritized over rendering, the event loop ensures that rendering happens at an optimal time.

// Rendering Pipeline: Involves recalculating styles, layout, and painting onto the screen (this includes handling CSS, HTML, and layout).
// Non-Blocking Rendering: JavaScript's single-threaded model doesnâ€™t block rendering entirely. The browser attempts to render after every turn of the event loop. However, heavy tasks in the microtask queue can delay rendering.
// Repaints and Reflows
// Reflow: Occurs when the browser must recalculate the layout of the page (i.e., when you change the size of an element).
// Repaint: Happens when changes are made to an elementâ€™s visual properties (like background color) that do not affect its layout.
// Event Loop Impact: Running too many microtasks can delay the rendering process. Efficiently managing tasks ensures the browser remains responsive.
// Example:

console.log("Start");

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  // A long-running microtask
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {}
  console.log("Microtask - Promise resolved");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Macro task - Timeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

// In this example, the promise's long loop may block the rendering from happening as expected.

// 9. Practical Examples and Code Walkthroughs
// Example 1: setTimeout vs. Promises
// Code:
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise resolved");
});

// Explanation:

// Promises go into the microtask queue and will always execute before the next macro task (like setTimeout).
// Output:

// javascript
// Copy code
// Promise resolved
// Timeout

// Example 2: Async/Await with Multiple Promises
// Code:
async function fetchData() {
  const data1 = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data1");
  const data2 = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data2");
  console.log("Data fetched");
}

fetchData();

console.log("Start");

// Explanation: The fetchData function is asynchronous, meaning it returns a promise. The await keyword pauses execution at that point until the promise resolves, but other code (like console.log('Start')) can continue executing synchronously.

// 10. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
// Avoiding Callback Hell
// Callback hell occurs when multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous logic. This leads to deeply nested, hard-to-read code.

// Solution: Use Promises or async/await syntax to flatten nested structures.
// Callback hell
asyncOp1(() => {
  asyncOp2(() => {
    asyncOp3(() => {
      console.log("Done");
    });
  });
});

// Solution: Promises
asyncOp1()
  .then(() => asyncOp2())
  .then(() => asyncOp3())
  .then(() => console.log("Done"));

// Managing Promise Chains
// Ensure you handle both fulfilled and rejected promise states to avoid unhandled promise rejections.

fetch("https://api.example.com")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));

// Preventing Memory Leaks
// Ensure asynchronous operations such as event listeners, timers, or promises do not accumulate unnecessarily, causing memory leaks. Clean up when the task is no longer needed.

// Example: Remove event listeners when no longer needed.
const button = document.querySelector("button");

const clickHandler = () => {
  console.log("Button clicked");
};

button.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);

// Later, remove listener
button.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler);

// Optimizing Asynchronous Code
// Avoid unnecessary promise chains or excessive use of await inside loops, as this can degrade performance.

// 11. Advanced Topics
// Web Workers and Multithreading
// JavaScript is single-threaded, but Web Workers enable concurrent execution on multiple threads. Web Workers cannot access the DOM, but they can perform computational tasks in the background.

// Example:
// main.js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage("Start computation");

worker.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log("Result from worker:", e.data);
};

// worker.js
onmessage = (e) => {
  let result = heavyComputation();
  postMessage(result);
};

// The Task Scheduling Algorithm
// Understanding the event loop's internal task scheduling helps optimize your code. Some browsers prioritize certain tasks, such as animations or user input, over others to ensure responsiveness.

// 12. Hands-On Projects
// Project 1: Building an Event-Driven Application
// Create a real-time chat application where messages are handled asynchronously. Use event emitters to manage message events, and promises to fetch data from APIs.

// Project 2: Optimizing Performance with the Event Loop
// Optimize a heavy computational task by offloading part of the work to Web Workers, ensuring the UI remains responsive during execution.

// 13. Assessment and Certification
// Quizzes and Assignments
// Complete a series of quizzes and hands-on coding assignments covering the Event Loop, promises, async/await, and optimization strategies.

// Final Project Evaluation
// Submit a project that demonstrates your understanding of asynchronous programming and the event loop. Example: Build a task scheduler that uses promises and manages execution order effectively.

// This master class provides an in-depth exploration of the JavaScript Event Loop, focusing on practical examples, problem-solving, and performance optimizations to enhance your skills as a JavaScript developer.
