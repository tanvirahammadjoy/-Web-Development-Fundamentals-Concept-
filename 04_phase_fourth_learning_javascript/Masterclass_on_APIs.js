// Masterclass on APIs: Understanding, Types, and Access Methods
// What is an API?
// API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs serve as intermediaries, enabling data exchange and functionality sharing between applications without exposing their internal workings.

// In simple terms, an API is like a waiter in a restaurant who takes orders from customers (the front-end or users), sends them to the kitchen (the back-end), and brings the food back (data or services).

// Why Do We Need APIs?
// Separation of Concerns: APIs help separate the front-end (UI) from the back-end (data processing). This separation allows teams to work independently on different parts of an application.
// Efficiency: APIs allow applications to reuse code and services, reducing redundancy and improving performance.
// Data Access: APIs enable secure and controlled access to data. They ensure that only authorized clients can interact with an application's data.
// Scalability: With APIs, you can create modular applications that can scale independently by interacting with other services and applications.
// Integration: APIs allow integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, social media logins, weather services).

// Types of APIs
// APIs can be classified into several types based on their purpose, communication protocols, or use cases. Here are the most common categories:

// 1. Web APIs (or Web Services)
// Web APIs enable communication between a client (e.g., browser, mobile app) and a server over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

// Examples of Web APIs:
// REST API (Representational State Transfer)
// SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)
// GraphQL API
// JSON-RPC & XML-RPC

// 2. Operating System APIs
// These APIs allow applications to interact with the underlying operating system. Examples include:
// Windows API
// POSIX API (for UNIX-based systems like Linux)
// macOS API

// 3. Library-based APIs
// These APIs provide a way for programs to access functions from external libraries or frameworks. For example:
// jQuery API
// Node.js API
// Java API

// 4. Hardware APIs
// Hardware APIs provide an interface between applications and physical devices like printers, cameras, and other peripherals.

// 5. Database APIs
// Database APIs allow applications to interact with a database management system (DBMS) to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data.
// Examples:
// JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting Java applications to databases.
// ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) for connecting applications to relational databases.

// 6. Remote APIs
// Remote APIs are designed to communicate with remote resources, often over a network. Web APIs (such as REST and SOAP) are examples of remote APIs.
// Types of Web APIs
// RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)
// Principle: It is based on the principles of REST architecture, which uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
// Data Format: Typically uses JSON or XML.
// Stateless: Each request from a client must contain all the information needed for the server to fulfill the request (no session information is stored server-side).
// Scalability: Easy to scale and adapt.

// Example:
// GET /users/12345
// POST /users
// PUT /users/12345
// DELETE /users/12345

// SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)
// Principle: A protocol-based API that relies on XML messaging and well-defined contracts between client and server.
// Data Format: Uses XML.
// Strict: SOAP APIs are more rigid, requiring detailed message structures.
// Security: It offers built-in security features (WS-Security), making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.

// Example SOAP Request:
// <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
//   <soapenv:Body>
//     <GetUserRequest>
//       <UserID>12345</UserID>
//     </GetUserRequest>
//   </soapenv:Body>
// </soapenv:Envelope>

// GraphQL
// Principle: GraphQL allows clients to query exactly the data they need, making it more flexible than REST.
// Data Format: Uses JSON.
// Efficiency: Instead of multiple requests (e.g., for user details and posts in REST), a single query can fetch related data.

// Example GraphQL Query:
// {
//   user(id: 12345) {
//     name
//     email
//     posts {
//       title
//       content
//     }
//   }
// }

// gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
// Principle: gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for efficient serialization, offering fast and compact communication.
// Data Format: Uses binary format (Protocol Buffers).
// High-Performance: Suitable for microservices, real-time communications, and inter-service communication in distributed systems.
// Why Do We Need to Convert Between API Formats?
// Converting between API formats (e.g., from REST to GraphQL, or from XML to JSON) can provide several benefits:

// Data Efficiency: Some API formats, like GraphQL, allow more efficient data retrieval by minimizing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
// Interoperability: Some systems or clients may prefer one data format (e.g., JSON) over another (e.g., XML), requiring conversion.
// Better Performance: APIs like gRPC are faster and more efficient than text-based APIs like REST for specific use cases.

// How to Access APIs?
// To access an API, clients usually make HTTP requests to a specific endpoint provided by the API. Here are different methods:

// 1. Direct HTTP Requests
// You can access APIs by making HTTP requests using tools like:
// Fetch API (in JavaScript)
// Axios (for making promises-based HTTP requests)
// Postman (for testing APIs)
// Curl (command-line tool)

// Example of a simple API request using Fetch (JavaScript):
fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

// 2. API Keys and Tokens
// Many APIs require authentication via API keys or tokens. These are unique identifiers that ensure only authorized users can access the API.

// Example using API Key in a request:
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})

// 3. OAuth (Open Authorization)
// OAuth is used for secure access to an API without exposing user credentials.
// Widely used by services like Google, Facebook, and GitHub to authorize access.

// 4. SDKs (Software Development Kits)
// Many platforms provide SDKs that simplify API access by abstracting the underlying requests.
// Example: AWS SDK for accessing AWS services, Google Cloud SDK for accessing Google services.

// Conclusion
// APIs are the backbone of modern software development. They facilitate communication between different systems, applications, and devices, making them essential for building scalable and efficient applications. By understanding different types of APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC) and access methods (HTTP requests, OAuth, SDKs), developers can make informed decisions when designing and interacting with APIs.

// By default come with which format before converting?

// By default, APIs typically come in either JSON or XML format, depending on the type of API and the technology stack used. Here are some common defaults based on API types:

// REST APIs:
// Default Format: Most modern REST APIs default to JSON as the data exchange format.
// Reason: JSON is lightweight, easy to parse, and widely supported across programming languages and platforms.

// SOAP APIs:
// Default Format: SOAP APIs use XML as the default format.
// Reason: SOAP is a protocol-based API that relies on the structured format of XML to define request/response schemas.

// GraphQL APIs:
// Default Format: GraphQL uses JSON by default for both requests and responses.
// Reason: GraphQL is designed to query and return precisely structured data, and JSON is well-suited for this task.

// gRPC APIs:
// Default Format: gRPC uses a binary format (specifically Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf) for communication.
// Reason: Binary formats are more efficient in terms of speed and size, especially for high-performance applications and microservices.

// In summary:
// REST: Defaults to JSON.
// SOAP: Defaults to XML.
// GraphQL: Defaults to JSON.
// gRPC: Defaults to binary (Protobuf).

// If you need to convert between formats (e.g., from XML to JSON), this can often be handled at the API level by specifying Content-Type or using libraries to transform the data.

// REST: Defaults to JSON.
// SOAP: Defaults to XML.
// GraphQL: Defaults to JSON.
// gRPC: Defaults to binary (Protobuf).

// Can you show me each of them demo?
// Sure! Here are demos for each of the mentioned API types: REST (JSON), SOAP (XML), GraphQL (JSON), and gRPC (Protobuf).

// 1. REST API (Default: JSON)
// Scenario: A simple REST API that returns user details in JSON format.

// Example Request:
// GET /users/1

// Example Response (JSON):
// {
//   "id": 1,
//   "name": "John Doe",
//   "email": "john.doe@example.com",
//   "age": 30
// }

// Implementation (JavaScript with Fetch):
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

// 2. SOAP API (Default: XML)
// Scenario: A SOAP API that returns user details in XML format.

// Example Request (SOAP Envelope):
// <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
//   <soapenv:Header/>
//   <soapenv:Body>
//     <GetUserRequest>
//       <UserId>1</UserId>
//     </GetUserRequest>
//   </soapenv:Body>
// </soapenv:Envelope>

// Example Response (XML):
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soapenv:Body>
    <GetUserResponse>
      <User>
        <Id>1</Id>
        <Name>John Doe</Name>
        <Email>john.doe@example.com</Email>
        <Age>30</Age>
      </User>
    </GetUserResponse>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

// Implementation (Using a SOAP Client): You would typically use a SOAP client like Postman, cURL, or SOAP libraries like soap in Node.js or Python's zeep to interact with SOAP APIs.

// 3. GraphQL API (Default: JSON)
// Scenario: A GraphQL API that retrieves user details with a specific query.

// Example Request (GraphQL Query):
// {
//   user(id: 1) {
//     name
//     email
//     age
//   }
// }

// Example Response (JSON):
// {
//   "data": {
//     "user": {
//       "name": "John Doe",
//       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
//       "age": 30
//     }
//   }
// }

// Implementation (JavaScript with Fetch):
fetch('https://api.example.com/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      {
        user(id: 1) {
          name
          email
          age
        }
      }
    `
  })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

// 4. gRPC API (Default: Binary with Protobuf)
// Scenario: A gRPC API that retrieves user details using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf).

// Protocol Buffers Definition:
// syntax = "proto3";

// service UserService {
//   rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
// }

// message UserRequest {
//   int32 id = 1;
// }

// message UserResponse {
//   int32 id = 1;
//   string name = 2;
//   string email = 3;
//   int32 age = 4;
// }

// Example Implementation (Node.js with gRPC and Protobuf):
// const grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');
// const protoLoader = require('@grpc/proto-loader');

// Load the protobuf definition
const packageDefinition = protoLoader.loadSync("user.proto", {});
const userProto = grpc.loadPackageDefinition(packageDefinition).UserService;

// Create a gRPC client
const client = new userProto(
  "localhost:50051",
  grpc.credentials.createInsecure()
);

client.GetUser({ id: 1 }, (error, response) => {
  if (!error) {
    console.log("User Details:", response);
  } else {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
});

// Example Request (Binary): The request will be binary encoded (Protobuf), and the server will return a Protobuf-encoded binary response:

// protobuf
// Copy code
// UserRequest { id: 1 }

// Example Response (Binary):
// UserResponse {
//   id: 1,
//   name: "John Doe",
//   email: "john.doe@example.com",
//   age: 30
// }

// Summary of Format Types
// REST (JSON): Returns human-readable JSON data.
// SOAP (XML): Uses XML for requests and responses with strict schemas.
// GraphQL (JSON): Allows clients to request exactly the data they need in JSON format.
// gRPC (Protobuf): Uses binary (Protobuf) for faster, more compact data transmission in high-performance scenarios.

// Let me know if you want more details on any specific implementation or examples!

// Now tell me about what is BSON?

// BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization format that extends JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It is primarily used to store and transfer data in a binary format rather than the human-readable text format of JSON. BSON was designed to be efficient both in terms of size and speed, particularly for databases and network communication.

// Key Features of BSON
// Binary Encoding:

// BSON is a binary format, which makes it faster to parse and more space-efficient than plain JSON, especially when handling large datasets.
// Supports More Data Types:

// While JSON supports basic types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, BSON adds support for more complex data types such as:
// Date objects
// Binary data (e.g., for images or file storage)
// Floating-point numbers
// Embedded documents (nested objects)
// Arrays
// Timestamps
// Null values
// ObjectId (a unique identifier used by MongoDB)
// Efficient for Database Use:

// BSON is the native data format used by MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It is optimized for read and write operations in databases, especially when dealing with hierarchical or nested data.
// Size and Speed Trade-off:

// BSON uses more space than JSON due to additional type information it stores. For instance, BSON includes length fields for objects and strings, which makes data parsing faster but at the cost of slightly increased size.
// BSON vs. JSON
// Feature	BSON	JSON
// Format	Binary	Text (human-readable)
// Size Efficiency	More efficient in certain cases	Typically smaller in plain text
// Speed	Faster for read/write operations	Slower due to text parsing
// Data Types	Supports more types (e.g., dates, binary data)	Limited to basic types (string, number, boolean)
// Use Case	Ideal for databases like MongoDB	Ideal for APIs and lightweight data exchange
// Scalability	Can handle large, complex datasets efficiently	Less efficient with very large datasets
// Example of BSON in MongoDB
// In MongoDB, when you insert a JSON document, it is converted to BSON for storage:

// JSON Document:
// {
//   "name": "John Doe",
//   "age": 30,
//   "email": "john.doe@example.com",
//   "createdAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
// }

// BSON Representation (binary, not directly readable):
// \x16\x00\x00\x00\x02name\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00John Doe\x00\x10age\x00\x1e\x00\x00\x00\x02email\x00\x18\x00\x00\x00john.doe@example.com\x00\x09createdAt\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff

// The BSON format is binary, with additional metadata like field lengths and types.
// When data is read from MongoDB, it is converted back to JSON for easy use in applications.

// Why BSON?
// Optimized for Databases: BSON is optimized for fast reads and writes, which is crucial for databases like MongoDB that handle large volumes of data.

// Supports Complex Data: BSON’s ability to store complex types like date objects and binary data makes it better suited for modern applications.

// Efficient Parsing: The binary format allows for more efficient parsing by machines compared to the text-based JSON, reducing CPU overhead.

// Use Cases of BSON
// MongoDB: BSON is MongoDB's native data format for storing documents. MongoDB automatically converts JSON documents to BSON when storing them and back to JSON when retrieving them.

// High-Performance Applications: Applications requiring fast data transfer and processing, especially in big data contexts, often use BSON due to its binary structure.

// Systems with Rich Data Models: BSON is ideal when applications need to store more complex types that JSON cannot handle natively (e.g., binary files or large numbers).

// Conclusion
// BSON is an extension of JSON designed for efficiency in storage and performance. While JSON is great for data interchange between web applications and APIs, BSON shines in use cases requiring speed and support for more complex data structures, making it the format of choice for databases like MongoDB.

// Let me know what I understood you can correct me if I wrong the api is a medium is an protocol in this way we can communicate with backend to backend and backend to front end and system to system, application to application in this way we can share our internal Resource as we want like a public school and a private school we puted some resources in some where server and from there some one can access to our resources by the api protocol right?

// Yes, you're on the right track! Here's a refined explanation based on what you said:

// API (Application Programming Interface) is a medium or protocol that allows different systems (backend to frontend, backend to backend, system to system, or application to application) to communicate and share resources. APIs define how requests and responses should be structured, allowing access to internal resources (like data or services) while maintaining control over what is shared.

// To relate to your example:

// Think of an API like the rules of a public or private school. The school (server) holds resources (data, services), and students or teachers (users or applications) can access only what the API (rules or protocol) allows. For public schools, more resources may be accessible to everyone, while private schools might have restricted access to certain resources.
// So, yes, the API acts as a controlled gateway for accessing resources on a server, following a protocol to ensure secure and structured communication between systems.

// You got it right!

// Or can we compare with an supper market was an stuff where we can access as an customer where we have access as normal customers as premium customers APIs sometimes work as an manager role sometimes as Security guard of that store basically the APIs is the A hole bundle set of roles that we use to communicate internally on the internet world like our physical world right you can make the story more organised way if you can it will be helpful?

// That's a great analogy! Let’s refine it to make it more organized and clear:

// API as a Supermarket Analogy:
// Imagine a supermarket (which represents a server or system) where customers (users, applications, or other systems) come to access products (resources like data or services). The API is like the staff that manage the interactions in the supermarket. Here's how it works:

// Customers and Access Levels:

// Normal Customers: Represent regular users or applications that only have access to basic products. In API terms, these would be public endpoints or open-access resources that anyone can use.
// Premium Customers: Represent users with a subscription or special permissions. These customers have access to more exclusive products. In API terms, premium users might have access to private or restricted resources.
// API as a Supermarket Staff:

// The Manager: The API sometimes acts as the manager of the store. The manager oversees which products can be accessed and by whom, ensuring that customers are following the rules. Similarly, the API manages access to resources, deciding which users or applications can retrieve certain data or services.
// The Security Guard: Sometimes the API plays the role of a security guard. It ensures that only authorized customers can enter certain sections of the store (protected endpoints), checking IDs (API keys, tokens) before granting access.
// The Checkout Clerk: The API can also act as a clerk, facilitating the exchange of products (resources). Just as a clerk processes payments and hands over products, the API processes requests and returns data in response.
// Supermarket’s Rules (API Protocol):

// The store has rules about what products are available, who can access them, and how to interact with the staff. This is similar to an API’s protocols and endpoints, which define how customers (applications) request resources and how those resources are delivered.
// Products on the Shelves (Resources):

// The supermarket stocks various products (data, services, or functionalities). Not all customers can access every product—some are behind restricted sections, some are for everyone. APIs control which data or services are available based on user roles or access rights.
// Organized Storyline
// In the digital world, the API is like the entire staff of a supermarket, ensuring that customers (applications or systems) can interact with the store (server or system) properly. The API controls:

// Who can enter (authentication)
// Which sections they can access (authorization)
// How they interact with the store (protocols and endpoints)
// Some customers might have access to premium sections (restricted data or services), while others have access only to basic products (public data). The API enforces these rules, just like a manager and security guard ensure that everyone follows the store's rules.

// Just as in the supermarket, where the staff ensures customers get the right products without chaos, APIs enable smooth, controlled communication between systems in the digital world, ensuring that resources are shared efficiently and securely.

// This analogy helps illustrate the role of APIs as a set of roles, rules, and protocols that govern how systems communicate and exchange data, much like the organized functioning of a supermarket!
