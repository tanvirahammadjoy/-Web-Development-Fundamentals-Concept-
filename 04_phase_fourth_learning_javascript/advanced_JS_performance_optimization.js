// 1. Understanding JavaScript Performance Bottlenecks
// Before optimizing your code, it's essential to understand where performance issues arise. Key tools like Chrome DevTools help you profile your app and measure JavaScript execution times.

// The Event Loop: Understanding how the event loop processes asynchronous operations (like setTimeout or Promises) can help avoid blocking the UI thread and improve perceived performance.

// Identifying Critical Rendering Path: This refers to the process of rendering content on the screen. By reducing unnecessary reflows and repaints, you can optimize rendering performance.

// 2. Optimizing JavaScript Execution
// Minimizing Reflow and Repaint: Changes to the DOM can trigger reflows (layout recalculation) or repaints (visual updates). Techniques like batching DOM updates, using documentFragment, or requestAnimationFrame can help minimize these.

// Example of batching DOM manipulation
let fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  let div = document.createElement("div");
  div.textContent = `Item ${i}`;
  fragment.appendChild(div);
}

// document.body.appendChild(fragment);
// Debouncing and Throttling: For events like scrolling or resizing, avoid excessive function calls by using debouncing or throttling to delay execution until the user has finished an action.

// Debounce function example
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Code Splitting and Lazy Loading: For large applications, loading all JavaScript upfront can slow down the initial page load. Code splitting divides code into chunks that are only loaded when needed, improving initial load performance.

// 3. Memory Management and Garbage Collection
// Memory Leaks: Long-lived references can cause memory leaks. For example, keeping references to DOM elements after they are removed from the document.

// Avoid memory leaks
function addEventListeners() {
  const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    // Use weak references or remove event listeners if not needed
  });
}

// 4. Improving DOM Manipulation Performance
// Direct access to the DOM is slow, so minimize it. Frameworks like React use a virtual DOM to batch updates, reducing reflow and repaint operations.

// Event Delegation: Attach event listeners to parent elements rather than adding individual listeners to each child element. This reduces memory usage and improves performance for dynamic elements.

document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Item clicked", event.target);
  }
});

// 5. JavaScript Engines and Compilation
// Modern JavaScript engines like V8 use Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize frequently executed code. Understanding how engines optimize (e.g., inline caching) allows you to write engine-friendly code.

// 6. Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms
// Choosing efficient data structures can dramatically improve performance. For example, using a Map over an object for key-value pairs when the keys are non-strings or using Set for collections that require uniqueness.

// Example of using Map
let map = new Map();
map.set("key1", "value1");

// 7. Concurrency and Parallelism in JavaScript
// JavaScript is single-threaded, but you can use Web Workers for heavy computations to run code in parallel, freeing up the main thread.

// Example of using Web Worker
let worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage("Start processing");

// 8. Optimizing Network Requests
// Reduce the number of network requests by combining assets and using HTTP/2. Implement caching strategies with Service Workers to reduce network round trips.

// 9. Performance Testing and Profiling Tools
// Tools like Chrome DevTools provide real-time performance analysis. The Performance Panel gives insights into JavaScript execution, layout, and rendering performance.

// 10. Real-World Use Cases and Code Optimization Techniques
// Use lazy loading for images and code. Implement Progressive Rendering to load visible content first while deferring the rest.

// Final Thoughts
// JavaScript performance optimization is not just about reducing load times but also about improving the overall user experience. Using these advanced techniques, you can make your web applications faster, more responsive, and efficient.
